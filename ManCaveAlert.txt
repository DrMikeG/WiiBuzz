Plan.

Button indoors which connects to wifi.
Server outdoor which connects to wifi

Push button is detected by server. Light flashes.

Broken torch provides light.

Torch runs at 3.5V.

12 LEDs to flash.
Constant draw was 60ma at 3.5V
Could I half this with PWM?

Planning to use ESP8266 ESP01's as transmitter and reciever.

Should test reception in mancave as first test.

Power? How do you power one?
I have a power supply, 3.5V and plenty of 5V?

Sucks a lot of power.

20 - 250ma!

Light to show connection - Can I use onboard LED?


I've had a lot of luck with my programming tonight.
I've had three examples working:

1) Connect to home wifi (FirstConnect.ino)
2) Act as a SoftAP and allow phone to connect to isolated IOT wifi (SoftAP)
3) Serve a webpage toggling GPIO pin with LED on - (WebPage.ino)

I think I want a combination of these - but I need to know more about the SoftAP

I want a transistor to power the LEDs.

The programming board is providing a really handy power supply. Perhaps I should got another?
